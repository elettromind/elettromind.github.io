## 3D Modelling
I don't just create 3D models, I turn your ideas into concrete, functional designs. Be it custom mechanical parts or custom objects such as covers or flower vases. I use the best software including SolidWorks and Fusion360 depending on the requirements of the project. My work also includes the design of complex systems such as robotic arms, which represent the challenge and passion for technical innovation.

## 3D Printing
I mould components using a wide range of materials, selected according to end use: from PLA and ABS, to PETG suitable for food environments, to carbon fibre and brass for parts that have to withstand wear and mechanical stress. There are also special materials such as Nylon and TPU for special applications. Thanks to my experience, I carefully select the most suitable material and optimise every detail to guarantee resistance, durability and professional results, perfectly tailored to each project.

***

## PCB design & realisation
Behind every PCB I design and realise is my certified experience with Altium and the attention of someone who personally solder each component. I have developed dozens of custom-made boards for specific applications, such as controlling pistons with magnetic reeds, and tested each board to ensure quality and reliability. Entrusting me with your project means betting on a job done to perfection.

## Konnex home automation systems
As a KNX partner, I create intelligent, tailor-made home automation systems that truly improve your quality of life. I am not just talking about switching lights on or off, but complex systems that optimise consumption, safety and comfort, all customised to your habits. I know this technology inside out and am ready to transform your home or business into a smart and modern environment.

***

## PLC programming
Automation is the key to more efficient and safer production processes. I programme PLCs with care and passion, creating solutions tailored to your specific needs. I test every programme carefully, because I know how crucial it is that everything runs smoothly and without risk.

***

## Simulation of automations in a virtual environment
Before installation, I simulate each automation in a virtual environment to test its operation and prevent problems. This method saves you time and money, ensuring a ready-to-use installation with no surprises. It is a professional approach that I always use, because I believe in quality from the first to the last step.

***

## Wiring diagrams
I produce detailed and easy to interpret wiring diagrams, which are essential for the correct management of installations. I use professional software such as EPLAN, but it is my practical experience that really makes the difference: I know how to draw diagrams that help those who have to install and maintain systems, simplifying work and increasing safety.

***

## Switchboard construction
I have gained direct experience in the assembly and wiring of switchboards, taking care of every detail with craftsmanship precision. Each switchboard is built to last, meet requirements exactly and guarantee safety. I know the value of a job well done, because I know that performance and peace of mind depend on it.
